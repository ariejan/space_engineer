# Contributing

## Issues

When opening an issue:

 * Include which version of Space Engineer you're running
 * Include your OS and phone brand / model. 

It's always better to include more info rather than less.

## Code

It's always best to open an issue before investing a lot of time into a
fix or new functionality. Functionality must meet my design goals and
vision for the project to be accepted; I would be happy to discuss how
your idea can best fit into Space Engineer.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the Space Engineer project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Ariejan de Vroom.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to me, that code becomes mine".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; I hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.

The reason for all this is that I need to keep ownership of this code base 
in order to make the game available (commercially) on different platforms.
