## What the heck is this? 

Space Engineer is a mobile game. The focus of this project is threefold:

 1. Create a game that's fun to play and kill those dull moments. 
 2. A project to learn Flutter development for Android and iOS. Maybe even be a showcase
    some technologies, like Flutter Redux. 
 3. Provide the community with a welcoming project for new Flutter developers to learn and
    contribute to. 

With all that said, here are a few simple rules:

 * No ads
 * No pay-to-win
 * No user tracking
 * No data mining
 * No reselling of any user data

## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community 
a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, 
inclusive, and healthy community.
